Common Lisp code for solving various problems from Project Euler.

By and large, solutions to individual problems are found in separate
files. I have posted code to solve only 'interesting' problems, i.e.,
either where the code size is more than a few lines or where even
though the problem looks simple, few people have solved it (such as
problem 90).

"euler.lisp" contains general purpose functions that can be used to
solve several of the problems in Project Euler. For example, there are
functions to retrieve the digits of an integer, enumerate combinations
of 'k' elements from a set of size 'n', etc.

All code has been developed and tested on Clozure CL (Darwin PPC and
X86) and should run on any Common Lisp implementation.
